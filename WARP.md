  description: >
    A coding assistant that writes clean, maintainable, and SOLID code for
    Flutter (GetX + Clean Architecture), Laravel (FilamentPHP + TailwindCSS),
    and Gatsby (React + GraphQL). 
    Keep things simple, small, and consistent across stacks.

general_rules:
  - Always follow SOLID principles and Clean Architecture patterns.
  - Keep files small and focused unless splitting increases complexity.
  - Avoid generating test files unless explicitly requested.
  - Use clear naming conventions and consistent folder structures.
  - Prefer readability and maintainability over optimization unless specified.
  - Do not repeat unchanged sections when updating code; mention “unchanged”.
  - Always minimize dependencies; use built-in or framework-native solutions when possible.
  - Ask for test results when needed, do not auto-run or generate tests.
  - Always explain architectural or design choices briefly if they’re non-trivial.
  - never generate code that is not needed.
  - never generate documentations unless it was a major changes
  - never genrate the content of svg files, you may only suggest the name of the svg file, like: linkedin.svg

stacks:

  flutter:
    - Use Clean Architecture structure:
        - presentation/: views, widgets, controllers
        - application/: screen controllers
        - domain/: entities, repositories, use cases
        - data/: models, Dio requests, repository implementations
    - State management: GetX only.
    - Keep UI code minimal and reactive.
    - Follow Dart naming conventions.
    - Use dependency injection through bindings (Get.put, Get.lazyPut, etc).
    - Avoid business logic inside widgets.

  laravel:
    - Use FilamentPHP for admin panel.
    - Use TailwindCSS for frontend.
    - Respect Laravel conventions (Controllers, Models, Services, Repositories).
    - Keep controllers thin; business logic goes into Services or Actions.
    - Separate concerns (Requests, Resources, Events, Jobs, Policies).
    - Prefer single-responsibility methods and small classes.
    - Use meaningful route names and resourceful controllers.
    - Maintain consistent naming across models and relationships.

  gatsby:
    - Use functional React components and hooks.
    - Prefer GraphQL queries colocated with components.
    - Use TailwindCSS for styling.
    - Keep pages and components small and composable.
    - Use custom hooks for reusable logic.
    - Avoid unnecessary state or props drilling.
    - Respect folder convention:
        - src/components/
        - src/pages/
        - src/hooks/
        - src/utils/
    - Favor static queries over runtime fetching when possible.

code_style:
  - Use consistent indentation and formatting.
  - Design Features:
    - Ultra-minimal color palette: Pure black/white with subtle grays for hierarchy
    - Bold typography: Larger heading (up to 7xl) with tight tracking and leading
    - Brutalist cards: Thick 2px borders with sharp corners for strong visual impact
    - Inverted accent card: The "Nexus" card uses inverted colors to stand out
    - Subtle animations: Hover effects with bottom border animations on cards
    - Geometric accents: Decorative border box and divider line for visual interest
    - Monospace labels: Font-mono for the connection labels adds technical feel
    - High contrast: Strong black/white contrast with proper dark mode support
    - Micro-pattern background: Very subtle dot grid (barely visible) adds texture
    - Arrow indicator: "→" prefix on tagline for directional emphasis

    - What makes it modern:
      - Clean spacing and generous whitespace
      - Strong typographic hierarchy
      - Border-based design (no shadows or gradients)
      - Interactive hover states
      - Brutalist/Swiss design influence
      - Functional, no-nonsense aesthetic

  The design feels contemporary, bold, and appropriate for an institute focused on serious global issues.
  - Always add minimal, meaningful comments only where necessary.
  - Follow framework-specific linting rules (e.g., Dart `flutter format`, Laravel PSR-12, Gatsby ESLint).
  - Avoid inline styles or hard-coded values.
  - Prefer constants/config for environment-specific data.

communication:
  - Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous.
  - Summarize changes concisely before generating code.
  - Never assume hidden requirements — always confirm intent.
