# Quick Start - Test the Brutalist Design System

## üöÄ Test Your Implementation (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start Development Server

```bash
cd /Users/ehsan/Desktop/TonyTony
gatsby develop
```

Wait for compilation to complete, then visit: `http://localhost:8000`

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Model Section

Scroll down to the **"From research to real-world impact"** section or directly navigate to `http://localhost:8000/#model`

---

### Step 3: Verify Visual Elements

Check that the following look correct:

#### ‚úÖ Section Layout
- [ ] Full-height dark section (black background)
- [ ] White text throughout
- [ ] Proper spacing around content

#### ‚úÖ Header
- [ ] Large heading: "From research to real-world impact"
- [ ] Bold white divider line below heading
- [ ] Subheading text in lighter gray

#### ‚úÖ Four Pillar Cards
- [ ] 4 cards in a grid (responsive: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 4 col desktop)
- [ ] Each card has subtle border (white/20 opacity)
- [ ] Border becomes fully white on hover
- [ ] Number badge (01-04) in top-right corner
- [ ] Card title is bold and large
- [ ] Description text is readable
- [ ] Bottom line expands from left to right on hover

#### ‚úÖ Bottom Decorative Element
- [ ] Horizontal lines on left and right
- [ ] Centered text: "Four pillars. One integrated approach."
- [ ] Text in uppercase, monospace font

---

### Step 4: Test Responsive Design

Resize your browser window or use dev tools:

| Breakpoint | Expected Behavior |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Mobile (< 640px)** | 1 column grid, smaller heading |
| **Tablet (640-1024px)** | 2 column grid, medium heading |
| **Desktop (> 1024px)** | 4 column grid, large heading |

---

### Step 5: Test Dark Mode (if implemented)

Toggle dark mode in your browser/OS and verify colors invert properly.

## üé® Visual Comparison

### Before (Pure Utility Classes)

```jsx
className="group relative p-8 border-2 border-white/20 hover:border-white transition-all duration-300 bg-black"
```

### After (Design System Classes)

```jsx
className="brutalist-card-minimal p-8"
```

**Result:** Identical visual output, cleaner code! ‚ú®

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Styles not applying

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear Gatsby cache and restart
gatsby clean
gatsby develop
```

### Issue: Classes not found

**Check:**
1. Is `global.css` imported in your layout?
2. Is the `@layer components` block uncommented?
3. Did Tailwind process the CSS file?

**Verify global.css is loaded:**
```bash
# Check if global.css exists
ls -la src/styles/global.css

# Should show 282 lines
wc -l src/styles/global.css
```

### Issue: Dark mode not working

**Check:** Make sure you have dark mode configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class', // or 'media'
  // ... rest of config
}
```

## ‚úÖ Approval Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] **Visual Output:** Looks identical to before refactor
- [ ] **Responsiveness:** Works on all screen sizes
- [ ] **Interactions:** Hover effects work correctly
- [ ] **Performance:** No noticeable slowdown
- [ ] **Code Quality:** Components are cleaner and more readable
- [ ] **Dark Mode:** Colors invert properly (if applicable)

---

## üìù Next Actions

### If Approved ‚úÖ

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add src/styles/global.css src/components/sections/ModelSection.js
   git commit -m "feat: implement Brutalist design system layer for ModelSection"
   ```

2. **Choose next component to migrate:**
   - Suggested: `HeroSection` (high visibility)
   - Use the same pattern as ModelSection

3. **Follow the migration checklist:**
   See `DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions

### If Changes Needed ‚ùå

1. **Document feedback** in a comment
2. **Adjust classes** in `global.css`
3. **Re-test** following this guide
4. **Repeat** until approved

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

The implementation is successful if:

1. ‚úÖ ModelSection looks **identical** to before
2. ‚úÖ Code is **cleaner** and more **semantic**
3. ‚úÖ You can **easily explain** what each class does
4. ‚úÖ You're **confident** about switching design systems later
5. ‚úÖ Other developers can **understand** the code quickly

- `DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Complete migration guide
- `BRUTALIST_CLASSES_CHEATSHEET.md` - Quick class reference
- `BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md` - Detailed comparison
- `src/styles/global.css` - All design system classes

## üí° Pro Tip

Keep Chrome DevTools open while testing:
1. **Inspect element** on a card
2. **See the class** applied (e.g., `brutalist-card-minimal`)
3. **Find the definition** in DevTools ‚Üí Styles
4. **Verify** all properties are coming from the design system

This confirms the layer system is working correctly!

**Time to test:** ~5 minutes  
**Expected result:** Everything works perfectly with cleaner code! üéâ
