# Next Steps - Action Items for You

## âœ… What's Been Done

I've successfully created a **simple, modern CMS admin panel** for your GNI Gatsby website. Here's what's ready:

- âœ… Clean admin interface at `/admin` route
- âœ… Edit hero, mission, initiatives, leadership, and site metadata
- âœ… Save changes to browser localStorage
- âœ… Export content to JSON
- âœ… Development-only (won't be in production)
- âœ… All main components updated to use the new content system

---

## ðŸš€ What You Need To Do

### 1. Test the CMS (Immediate)

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run develop
```

Then:
1. Open `http://localhost:8000/admin` in your browser
2. Try editing some content
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see your changes live
5. Test the Export/Reset buttons

### 2. Add More Sections (If Needed)

The CMS currently covers:
- Hero Section âœ…
- Mission âœ…
- Initiatives âœ…
- Leadership âœ…
- Site Metadata âœ…

**If you need more sections** (About, Gallery, Contact, Slogan, Model, etc.), you can:

1. Add them to `src/data/content.json`
2. Create editor components in `src/pages/admin/index.js`
3. Update the corresponding section components to use `useContent()`

Let me know if you need help adding more sections!

### 3. Update Remaining Sections (Optional)

These sections are not yet connected to the CMS:
- `AboutUsSection.js`
- `GallerySection.js`
- `ModelSection.js`
- `SloganSection.js`
- `ExploreSliderSection.js`
- `ContactSection.js`

If you want to make these editable through the admin panel, we can add them too.

### 4. Customize the UI (Optional)

You can customize the admin panel by editing:
- `src/pages/admin/index.js` - Main admin interface
- Colors, spacing, layout, etc.

### 5. Production Workflow

When ready to deploy:

```bash
# 1. Edit content in admin panel
# 2. Export JSON
# 3. Replace content.json
mv ~/Downloads/content.json src/data/content.json

# 4. Build
npm run build

# 5. Deploy the public/ folder
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority Actions

1. **TEST NOW**: Run `npm run develop` and visit `/admin` to try it out
2. **Add Images**: Manually add any new images to `static/assets/` folders
3. **Try Workflow**: Edit â†’ Save â†’ Export â†’ Replace â†’ Build
4. **Decide on Additional Sections**: Do you want About/Gallery/Contact editable too?

---

## ðŸ¤” Questions to Consider

1. **Do you need more sections in the CMS?**
   - If yes, which ones? (About, Gallery, Contact, etc.)

2. **Do you want image upload functionality?**
   - Currently, you add images manually to `static/assets/`
   - We can add a more sophisticated solution if needed

3. **Any other content types?**
   - Newsletter settings?
   - Social media links?
   - Footer content?

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- The admin panel saves to localStorage, so changes persist during development
- Always export JSON before building for production
- The admin route `/admin` won't exist in production builds (this is intentional)
- You can customize everything - it's your code!
