# Homepage Image Content for Helth NGO

## Main Hero Image/Video Still
*   **Main Idea:** A vibrant, hopeful image showcasing community engagement and the direct impact of Helth's work.
*   **Description:** A wide shot of a diverse group of people (adults and children) in a rural or underserved community, smiling and interacting positively with a Helth community health worker or medical professional. The setting should convey a sense of warmth and connection, perhaps with a mobile clinic in the background or a health education session taking place outdoors. The image should feel authentic and not staged, emphasizing human connection and care. Colors should be natural and inviting.

## Rotating Impact Story Images

### Image 1: Community Health Workers
*   **Main Idea:** A close-up, authentic shot of a Helth community health worker engaging with a community member.
*   **Description:** A Helth CHW (wearing identifiable but subtle branding, e.g., a vest or badge) is seen patiently explaining something to an elderly woman or a mother with a child. The focus should be on their faces, showing empathy, trust, and understanding. The background could be a simple home or community setting, reinforcing the local context.

### Image 2: Telehealth Innovation
*   **Main Idea:** Visual representation of technology bridging geographical gaps in healthcare.
*   **Description:** A split image or a composite image. One side shows a patient (e.g., a person in a rural setting) interacting with a tablet or smartphone, possibly with a Helth CHW assisting. The other side shows a medical professional (doctor or specialist) on a screen, engaged in a consultation. The image should convey seamless connection and modern solutions reaching remote areas.

### Image 3: Sustainable Solutions
*   **Main Idea:** Depicting local empowerment and self-sufficiency in health.
*   **Description:** An image showing local community members involved in a sustainable health initiative. This could be a small-scale local manufacturing facility for medicines (e.g., a clean, organized lab space with local workers), or a community garden project promoting nutrition, or a group of people managing a local health resource. The emphasis is on local ownership and long-term viability.
