# Health NGO Website Content Strategy

## 1. Introduction

## 2. NGO Core Identity (from User Document)

### Vision
A world where every person—regardless of geography, income, or social status—can access the basic health care and essential health commodities they need, when they need them.

### B. Image Content
*   **Main Idea:** Images should convey hope, community, empowerment, and the tangible impact of the NGO's work. They should be authentic, diverse, and respectful of the communities served.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Authentic Field Photography:** High-quality photos of health workers interacting with community members, mobile clinics in action, health education sessions, local manufacturing/distribution, and beneficiaries (with consent).
    *   **Portraits:** Close-up, dignified portraits of beneficiaries, local health workers, and community leaders.
    *   **Infographics/Data Visualizations:** Visual representation of impact metrics, health statistics, and operational reach (e.g., number of people served, vaccinations delivered, areas covered).
    *   **Illustrations/Icons:** Clean, modern illustrations for abstract concepts or to break up text, consistent with brand identity.
    *   **Stock Photography (Limited):** Only used when authentic photos are unavailable, ensuring diversity and relevance, avoiding stereotypical or overly clinical imagery.
*   **Inspiration (Tony Blair Institute):** The TBI website uses high-quality, professional photography, often featuring people in action or conceptual imagery related to global issues. The images are generally serious and convey a sense of purpose and scale.

### C. Video Content
*   **Main Idea:** Videos should tell compelling stories, showcase impact, explain complex initiatives simply, and inspire engagement. They should be emotionally resonant and visually engaging.
*   **Types & Length Recommendations:**
    *   **Short Impact Stories (1-3 minutes):** Focus on a single beneficiary or community, highlighting a specific problem and how "Helth" provided a solution. Ideal for social media and website landing pages.
    *   **Program Overviews (2-5 minutes):** Explain a specific service or initiative (e.g., telehealth program, community health worker training) with interviews, on-the-ground footage, and clear explanations of processes and outcomes.
    *   **Testimonials (30-90 seconds):** Direct interviews with beneficiaries, local partners, or health workers sharing their experiences and the positive change brought by the NGO.
    *   **Advocacy/Thought Leadership (3-7 minutes):** Interviews with experts, policy briefs explained visually, or short documentaries on systemic health challenges and "Helth"'s proposed solutions. Similar to the TBI's approach to showcasing their work and thought leadership.
    *   **"Day in the Life" Videos (3-5 minutes):** Follow a community health worker or a mobile clinic team to show the daily operations and challenges, building empathy and understanding.
*   **Video Style:** Professional, documentary-style, with clear audio and engaging visuals. Use subtitles for accessibility. Incorporate drone footage for establishing shots of communities, if appropriate and feasible.

## 6. Call to Actions (CTAs)

*   "Partner With Us" (Collaboration)
*   "Learn More About [Specific Program]"
*   "Read Our Impact Report"
*   "Join Our Team" (Careers/Volunteering)

## 7. Content Distribution & SEO Considerations
*   **SEO:** Optimize all text content with relevant keywords (e.g., "health equity," "community health," "global health NGO," "sustainable healthcare").
*   **Social Media:** Create shareable snippets, images, and short video clips for platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and Instagram.
*   **Email Marketing:** Leverage newsletter sign-ups for regular updates, impact stories, and calls to action.
