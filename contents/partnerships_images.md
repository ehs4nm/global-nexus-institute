## 1. Why Partner with Helth?
*   **Main Idea:** Visualizing diverse hands coming together, symbolizing collaboration and shared goals.
*   **Description:** A close-up shot of several hands, representing different demographics and professional roles (e.g., a community member, a Helth staff member, a government official, a private sector representative), clasped or stacked together in a gesture of unity and partnership. The background could be slightly blurred, suggesting a global context or a community setting.

## 2. Our Partnership Models

    *   **Government Partnerships:** A handshake between a Helth representative and a government official, perhaps with a national flag subtly in the background.
    *   **Community & Local Organization Partnerships:** Helth staff interacting with local community leaders or members in a village setting, sharing ideas or working together.
    *   **Donor & Philanthropic Partnerships:** A symbolic image of growth or investment, perhaps hands planting a tree or a stylized graphic representing financial support leading to positive impact.
    *   **Private Sector Partnerships:** A modern, clean image showing technology or innovation, possibly a subtle integration of a corporate logo with Helth branding.
    *   **Academic & Research Partnerships:** People looking at data, charts, or scientific equipment, symbolizing research and evidence-based approaches.
